USER STORY
AS a person who wants to have a tasty beverage
I WANT to see what breweries are in the city I'm going to
and what is available nearby

If I put in a city to look at
THEN an available list of breweries are displayed
IF I want to find something near me
THEN I can search by distance and what is around me
IF I want to look back on what has interested me
THEN local storage can access my liked data
WHEN I click on a listed brewery
THEN a Google Map with Information Displays
